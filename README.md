Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) to get started. Set up billing and create a new project. Don't worry about getting billed, the scale of this project should fall well inside the free tier.
Once the project is set up, go to the [Cloud Functions](https://console.cloud.google.com/functions) to begin importing the code that will be executed.
